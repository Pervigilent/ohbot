# ohbot

## Introduction

This repository contains code for the talking heads project. This is a robotics project at Lowell Makes which uses the Arduino to control a robotic head called the 'oh-bot' which utilizes small servos.

## Sections

The repository is divided into several folders:

### Audio

The audio processing is inside of the audio folder.

### Windows

The version of the code intended to run on Microsoft Windows after compilation in Microsft Visual Studio is stored in this folder. This folder currently just contains debug versions of the code for running in Visual Studio.

### Linux

This folder has not yet been created, but will contain Linux versions of any code.

### Arduino

This folder had not yet been created, but all sketches will be moved here.

## Tasks

- [] Interface an esp32 with a Bluetooth speaker
- [] Play an mp3 on the Bluetooth speaker
- [] Send timed commands to another esp32 over serial/wireless (while playting mp3)
- [] Determine cues for each oh-bot head
- [] Write conductor program using all of the above
