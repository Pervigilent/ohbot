## Introduction

This repository contains code for the talking heads project. This is a robotics project at Lowell Makes which uses the Arduino to control a robotic head called the 'oh-bot' which utilizes small servos.

## Tasks

- [] Interface an esp32 with a Bluetooth speaker
- [] Play an mp3 on the Bluetooth speaker
- [] Send timed commands to another esp32 over serial/wireless (while playting mp3)
- [] Determine cues for each oh-bot head
